## About

## History:

This mode was added in StepMania 4 CVS. It was designed to be a keyboard based mode using 7 keys and was requested by the community.

The mode initially started life with 6 columns, but this was resolved when the SSC builds began.

``kb7-small`` was a modded version of the mode, with a much smaller 'spacebar' or middle button. It was more used than it's original, and replaced the original ``kb7-single`` as the mode in Project OutFox.
