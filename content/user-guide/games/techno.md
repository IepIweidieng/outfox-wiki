## About

## History:

This mode was added in the 3.0.2, with the first mode being 8 panel. Like most modes from this period, there were not many theme items or specifics in scoring or timing windows at all.

In the development of SM 4.0, this mode was broken with the rapid changes brought into the game and was then fixed again by Team SSC in StepMania 5 Preview 4, restoring doubles and noteskin support.
