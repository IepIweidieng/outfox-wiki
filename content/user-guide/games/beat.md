## About

## History:

This mode was added in the 3.0 beta era, starting off life as a simple mode with no keysounds or even using the correct keys. The familiar 7K setup we know and love was added later in 2005.

The mode did not see much use and fell into having a broken notesloader around the summer of 2010, making it not work with older BMS files, or files with BME or BML extensions. Many files were misinterpreted or just did not load at all, and some were even seen as ``pomu`` songs when they were not. The overdue revamp of the loading system in 2021 fixed many of these bugs, allowing this mode to function and flourish once more. Even as of _Project OutFox_ Alpha 4.10.0 work is ongoing.

This mode was merged back into the 'bm' mode due to a duplication of styles. The IIDX side of the simulator was barely used, so it made sense to move towards the BMS specification which was more common at the time, and this was also used for early ``dance`` based songs as well, (4 panel and 6 panel BMS files).
