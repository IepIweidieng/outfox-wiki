# About

## History:

This mode (``kb7``) was added in StepMania 4 CVS. It was designed to be a keyboard based mode using 7 keys and was requested by the community, as an alternative to the dance only focus at the time, with a view of providing keyboard players a better streamlined experience in the engine.

The mode initially started life with 6 columns, but this was resolved when the SSC builds began.

``kb7-small`` was a modded version of the mode, with a much smaller 'space bar' or middle button. It was more used than it's original, and replaced the original ``kb7-single`` as the mode in Project OutFox.

In the final release of 2021, Project OutFox 4.12 replaced the original mode completely with a new rewritten version which allowed players to use a differing number of lanes, ranging from 1 to 15 in total. It also created a newer streamlined version of the system to give a small performance boost to this mode. Community member MDR has contributed some ideas to this mode.

_This mode is still being developed, so feedback and suggestion is welcome!_

## Game play

This mode is played default in down scroll, with the note receptors at the bottom of the screen. The mode has several different noteskins available to it, with some of them reflecting the currently _mapped_ button to the lane you need to press when the note hits the receptor.

### Mechanics
**_lift holds_**, **_anti-mash_**, **_tick holds_**, **_anything goes_**, **_disabled mods_**, **_down scroll_**

_lift holds_ are on by default! You will need to lift at the end of each long note in time, or you will be judged a miss. You can turn it off in the modifier menu.

_anti-mash_ is enabled to prevent button spam on some of the difficult charts, and the game will judge you as a miss and will break combo.

_tick holds_ are active on this mode, holding a long note will increase combo per tick.

_anything goes_ in this mode, as it is able to read almost everything the game supports.

_disabled mods_ exist in this mode, as this mode is aimed to be better optimised for better playback. Mod files will play, but without any gimmick or effects.

### Key Mapping:

The default mapping for this mode is as follows: Please bear in mind, the button layout still needs work!

```
kb1  = space
kb2  = f j
kb3  = f space j
kb4  = d f j k
kb5  = d f space j k 
kb6  = s d f j k l
kb7  = s d f space j k l
kb8  = a s d f j k l ;
kb9  = a s d space f j k l ;
kb10 = a w s d f j k l p ;
kb11 = a w s d f space j k l p ;
kb12 = a w s d r f j i k l p ;
kb13 = a w s d r f space j i k l p ;
kb14 = a w s e d r f j i k o l p ;
kb15 = a w s e d r f space j i k o l p ;
```
