## About

## History:

This mode was added in Project OutFox. It was added to provide users with a 5/9/10 lane drum mode that works on linux and Mac OS.

When added, players could use the auto-gen system to test it out, and there is noticeable lag on windows due to the sound drivers. This will be resolved in a future release.

This mode is selectable in the game select screen.
