## What is OutFox Serenity?

OutFox Serenity is the official community song pack project **made primarily for Project OutFox**. It's purpose is to produce packs of "libre" songs for the game that can be freely redistributed (including as part of its default, bundled songs), and to showcase the functionality of Project Outfox by offering charts for multiple gametypes beyond just 4-key/dance.

## How was OutFox Serenity created?

During Project OutFox Alpha 4.8.0 development, we started to release many modes, however, some of those modes have complicated chart standards or no longer have support. We decided then that it was right to create a community pack based on StepMania StepMix where the community would contribute for songs to be bundled with the game, but this time, songs for every mode OutFox supports.

## How can I contribute to OutFox Serenity?

1. Make sure to [read our guidelines](https://projectoutfox.com/serenity-guidelines) to understand the rules of contribution and submission.
2. Fill [our online form](https://projectoutfox.com/community-pack-submissions) selecting the option of which you want to submit and any other required information. 


- If you have **music** that follows our **Music guidelines**, then please submit it using [our online form](https://projectoutfox.com/community-pack-submissions), once you submit you have agreed that we have permission to store/share your content with members of our team to organize the selection of future volumes of OutFox Serenity.

- If you want to contribute with charts for:
    - Old volumes ([Volume I](https://github.com/TeamRizu/OutFox-Serenity/tree/main/OutFox%20Serenity%20Volume%201)), you have two options:
        - Join our [OutFox Serenity Discord Server](https://discord.gg/mNcFU67mK7) to get feedback and submit directly to our team.
        - Make a Pull Request on our [OutFox Serenity Github Repository](https://github.com/TeamRizu/OutFox-Serenity). Remember to follow **Chart Guidelines**.
    - Future Volumes: You need to join our [OutFox Serenity Discord Server](https://discord.gg/mNcFU67mK7) and use "chart-discussion" and "chart-feedback" channels.

    In both options we will request you to use our templates which can be found on our [OutFox Serenity Discord Server](https://discord.gg/mNcFU67mK7). Make sure to check the pinned messages as they include each gamemode scaling.

- If you want to contribute with graphics, then follow the same steps given to chart contribution. But instead use the "graphics" channels on our Discord server.

## Are modfiles allowed to be submitted?

Yes. But make sure it's gimmicks only works with your specific chart/difficulty, no chart should impact other's chart in any way.

## I submitted music but it wasn't featured on the next volume, why?

Our team has a list of music submitted by members of the community, we try to select a safe amount of music that guarantees a healthy amount of charts will be made for each one, since chart and graphic submissions are made purely by the interest of the authors and at the moment of writing this document, Project OutFox has no dedicated Chart Creation Team.

Another possible reason is that your submission does not follow the **music guidelines**, if you think that is the case then you can contact us using the following socials:

- [Discord](https://discord.gg/mNcFU67mK7)
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutFox) (Post or Private Message any Mods)
- [Project OutFox Forum](https://discourse.projectmoon.dance/) (Create a post)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/projectoutfox) (Private Message)
- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ProjectOutFox/) (Private Message)
- [Github](https://github.com/TeamRizu/OutFox/discussions) (New Discussion)

Make sure to check any of the socials you provided to us, if we are considering using your music but it's missing something, we will try to contact you.

## Why are some music files missing from the repository?

Those are special as they use a license which doesn't allow us to publicly host them on Github, they are still bundled with our release zips.
