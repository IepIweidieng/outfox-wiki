## Signed Mac builds update!
We have continued to worked on our Mac builds since the last alpha, and this alpha will be released as a ``universal`` binary. This means we do not need to quarantine, nor worry about the systems we needed in the past to get the game to work. OutFox is fully signed and notorised, so this means installation is convenient and easy moving forward; you do not need to worry about which build to grab, as both will function as expected.
