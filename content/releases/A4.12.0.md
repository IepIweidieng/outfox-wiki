## New Folder Locations and Short News Update.

This release will be moving the base application, folders and it's naming to 'OutFox'. This means it will not be using the 'stepmania5.3' folder anymore, and it will install into an outfox folder. You will need to move your profiles over to this new version. The old version will also need to be uninstalled manually, sorry about all of this, it is just for this update.

There is no conspiracy behind the name change, we have to do this for application signing on the Mac and for the 'MS Smart Screen' requirements for the certificates we need on Windows. This allows us to continue to be a free rhythm game that is now signed to ensure your confidence in the project, as well as ensuring the installers and packages are not tampered with. The Windows builds will be signed starting from next year, as it has taken time for the verification to complete. Our MacOS builds have been signed for a few alpha versions now, and with the 'universal' binaries we are making the Mac experience better for our Apple Players.

With this release we are announcing that Project OutFox is becoming it's own official fork. This gives an end to the confusion about our direction and this also allows those who wish to keep 5.1 installed having no risk of OutFox over-writing or damaging profiles or stored scores.

I'd like to thank the StepMania community for making this decision a lot easier. The project is not the same as we started out in early 2019, and we are sorry we were unable to have a clearer 'direction' than just 'modernising the codebase' when we started. It is not our place to shoehorn this project into the StepMania repo, and a lot of you were very open about your feelings about that and as a result, Project OutFox will be on it's own moving forward, and we will discuss with the StepMania community about what support we can bring in the future.

This month, we start off on our journey as a new standalone project, and thus a very exciting time ahead for our team. We have a new touch based theming system coming, new online, new leader-boards, (more new modes of course!) new platforms and modernisations to come over the next year. With the 2nd anniversary of the Public Alpha Programme, the team thanks you for the support and the good vibes you have brought us as we work on this project, and we hope you'll stay with us for the rest of the journey!

## Signed Mac builds update!

We have continued to work on our Mac builds since the last alpha, and this alpha will be released as a universal binary. This means we do not need to quarantine, nor worry about the systems we needed in the past to get the game to work. OutFox is fully signed and notorised, so this means installation is convenient and easy moving forward; you do not need to worry about which build to grab, as both will function as expected.

## New Unicode/SHIFT-JIS support!

This build also has _very_ long overdue extended character support in the file handlers. BeMusic Script, and DTXMania files use different encodings to .SSC and .SM simfiles, and in the past, they often showed up as garbage characters, or mojibake characters which could not be easily read into the game. A simple fix for this was to convert the simfile into UTF8, but with many hundreds of files, this is not reasonable to ask of players!

##### _(DTXMania Files natively loading)_

This build correctly can detect the encoding with no user interaction, and will load them as expected into the correct game mode. 

The new supported encoding types are:

* ANSI/Windows Extended (``SMA``/``BMS``/``DWI``/``KSF``)
* SHIFT-JIS (``BMS``/``BME``/``PMS``/``DTX``/``GDA``/``TJA``)
* UTF-8 (``DTX``/``BME``/``SSC``/``SM``/``OTO``)
* UTF-8 BOM (``GDA``/``DTX``)
* UTF-8 Extended (``TJA``/``BME``/``DTX``)
* UTF-16 (``DTX``)
* UTF-16LE (``DTX``)
* UTF-16LE BOM (``DTX``)
* UCS-2 (``DTX``)

This will mean songs using the new code paths for the encoding support will take a little bit longer to parse the first time, but having the support over not having it is worth it.

There will be opportunities to optimise the loading path, so it will get faster again!

# New and Updated Input Options!

## ALL OS: _``portmidi`` comes out of beta!_

##### _prototype fsr midi controller_

![teensyprototypebreadboard](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/721759411516866610/872518375593627759/IMG_20210804_173611.jpg)

This driver was written to accommodate the new DTXMania like mode, as the drum kits a lot of players use are MIDI based. This was the first time that our engine contained a fully functioning cross platform MIDI driver, the previous semi-broken ``win32-midi`` being Windows only. This new driver offers a 1ms clock timer and near realtime input on Linux and Mac OSX, but only supports _one_ device connected to the system.

_We are in the process of designing a MIDI based FSR controller for modes which need it as the MIDI system is currently the lowest latency for Windows based systems, and we hope to open source this in time, when the code is better (and Squirrel has the time!)_

The reason we kept it in beta for so long was there was an identified need to have a MIDI driver capable of supporting more than one MIDI input device, as had been requested by ``be-mu`` and ``gddm`` players, like DTXMania has, being able to add a second device to enable menu control, or to enable non-standard setups, for example pedals or ride cymbals from a second kit.

To assist with this need, we added another MIDI driver to the game: 

``rtmidi``

This driver allows for more than one device support compared to our ``portmidi`` driver, which is limited to a single device, like an e-drum kit, or a DJ controller. ``rtmidi`` allows for more than one device to be connected for 2 player use, or for extra control for menu options for example.

The new ``rtmidi`` driver can be added to your preference.ini if you wish to use it:

**Windows**
```
(portmidi - you only have one device):
InputDrivers=portmidi,legacy,minisdl

(rtmidi - you have more than one device):
InputDrivers=rtmidi,legacy,minisdl
```

**Mac OS (M1 and Intel)**
```
(portmidi - you only have one device):
InputDrivers=portmidi,SDL

(rtmidi - you have more than one device):
InputDrivers=rtmidi,SDL
```

**Linux (x86_64/ARM/Raspberry Pi)**
```
(portmidi - you only have one device):
InputDrivers=portmidi,SDL

(rtmidi - you have more than one device):
InputDrivers=rtmidi,SDL
```
---
## WINDOWS: _``legacy`` set to be the default and is out of beta!_

If you have been reading the previous changelogs, we have been testing a slightly modified version of the old SM4/5 input driver for those that prefer the 'feel' of that era in input timing, and until the new GA driver is finished, (we are waiting for the Q1 2022 Win10/Win11 update) we will set this driver as default from this alpha.

If you are on an established preference.ini, to use it you can follow the style above:

**Windows**
```
InputDrivers=legacy,minisdl
```

You can also leave this blank, or add MIDI if you plan to play DTX or use a MIDI based input device in the future. You will need the ``minisdl`` input driver for your window and operating system controllers, it allows for a smaller footprint on the game, and for your windows based playback this is important at the moment. It shows up in the 'test input' screen as 'Window Handler (aux)' so you have window controls, and full-screen etc support while keeping the base drivers compact. This driver will be default on all operating systems in due course, when the GA driver is complete.

if you however need to have an Xinput supported device, or you have an advanced setup, you can reset the driver to how it was before this alpha with a simple change in your preference.ini:

```
InputDrivers=SDL
```
This will enable the support for the Xinput system, and the legacy system in the default theme experimental options, (the ``UseOldJoystickMapping`` one) which will allow you to switch between the options.

---

If you use a _ParaParaParadise_ controller you will need to add the ``Para`` Driver (windows only right now!) before your options in preferences.

_Legacy Driver_
```
InputDrivers=legacy,minisdl
```
_SDL Driver_
```
InputDrivers=Para,SDL
```
---

If you use a _Reflex_ controller, you have several options, however it is best on Windows if you use the new legacy driver for now. To enable the _Reflex_ controller , you need to add the following to your entry: (please note: You need legacy for keyboard input and to avoid HIDAPI problems!)

(Only one player is supported at this time, however if there is demand we can add more player support! Bug Squirrel for more information!)

```
InputDrivers=Reflex,legacy,minisdl
```

If you have a ``Python2/3`` controller, like the above set up for the _Reflex_ you can simply add your entry here, (remember to set up your COM ports etc as seen in the Windows Device Manager) and remember that this device is not seen in Windows 8 or higher due to the change in the way USB controllers became emulated.

```
InputDrivers=Python23IO,legacy,minisdl
```
